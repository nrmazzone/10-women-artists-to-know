                <p>Artemisia Gentileschi was an early Italian Baroque painter, and the only female follower of Caravaggio, whom she worked with in Italy in the early 17th century. Her innovative compositions and 
                focus on Biblical heroines set her apart from her male contemporaries and have lead to the celebration of Gentileschi as a painter with a uniquely female perspective. In 1616, she was the first 
                woman to be accepted into the Florentine Academy of Fine Arts, where she continued her artistic education. During this period, Gentileschi was held in high esteem by both the royal court and scholars, 
                eventually establishing a much-heralded relationship with the astronomer, philosopher, and physicist, Galileo.</p>

                        <p>Giulia Lama appears to have been the first woman to break the barrier against women studying and drawing the nude figure from life. Over 200 drawings were recently discovered and clearly 
                        show that she indeed studied both male and female nude figures during her training. She had public success in a style that was typically a position held by men, giving rise to opposition 
                        from her male counterparts who were not prepared to tolerate such competition. As a highly trained professional, she was just as capable of painting a sensitive portrait, as she was of 
                        carrying out large, original commissions, such as altarpieces, with confidence.</p>

                    <p>When the second Impressionist exhibition opened in the spring of 1876 in Paris, one sharp-tongued critic described its participants as "five or six lunatics, one of which is a woman."
                       The woman, of course, was Berthe Morisot. Morisot cultivated her artistic talents and achieved success at an early age with acceptance to the Salon at age 23, and tenaciously held on 
                       to her rank at the forefront of French painters until her death 30 years later. Though frequently self-critical of her own work, and barred by social conventions from pursuing the same 
                       subject matter as her male counterparts, her talents and skill won her the public respect of her male colleagues as their equal - an achievement that was very uncommon for the times.</p>

                                Masters. Cassatt's art typically depicted domestic settings, the world to which she herself (as a respectable woman) was restricted, Her material was occasionally dismissed as 
                                quintessentially "feminine," yet most critics realized that she brought considerable technical skill and psychological insight to her subject matter.</p>

                         <p>Gabriele Münter was a German Expressionist painter best known for her poetic stylization of landscapes, self-portraits, and domestic interiors. She studied at the city’s progressive 
                            Phalanx School, under the famed Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. She belonged to  the Expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter. Their group championed the connection between visual art 
                            and music, although artistic approaches and aims varied, the group shared a common desire to express spiritual truths through art. For Münter, it is the use of color that expresses 
                            these ideas, she noted that pictures are all moments of life, instantaneous visual experiences, generally rapid and spontaneous.</p>

                <p>Fiercely committed to portraying the plights of workers and peasants, Käthe Kollwitz rendered the grief and harrowing experiences of both historical and contemporary wars in the 
                first decades of the 20th century. Bucking usual artistic trends, Kollwitz adopted printmaking as her primary medium, and drawing from her own socialist and anti-war sentiments, 
                she harnessed the graphic and expressive powers of the medium to present to the public an unvarnished look at the root causes and long-lasting effects of war. While her interest 
                in printmaking and sometimes her subject matter coincided with the Expressionist painters in Germany, she remained independent from them, charting her own path in the burgeoning 
                 world of modern art. </p>

                     Castelli’s landmark 1951 exhibition the “Ninth Street Show.” Her work is praised for the compositional rhythms, and bold color tones applied with energetic gestural brushstrokes. 
                     Her body of work resides somewhere between the meticulously prepared, structured composition and raw, untamed improvisation. The painter’s large-scale multi-paneled paintings are 
                     marked with abstract, richly colored calligraphic elements that are the key characteristics of her unique style and made her one of the most prominent figures of American Abstract

                    <p>Helen Frankenthaler made her debut in Adolph Gottlieb’s group show “Fifteen Unknowns” at New York’s Kootz Gallery in 1950. She was influenced by Abstract Expressionist 
                    painting practices, but developed her own distinct approach to the style. She invented the "soak-stain" technique, in which she poured turpentine-thinned paint onto 
                    canvas, producing luminous color washes that appeared to merge with the canvas and deny any hint of three-dimensional illusionism. Her breakthrough gave rise to the 
                    movement promoted by the influential art critic Clement Greenberg as the "next big thing" in American art.</p>

                <p>Born in Vermont but raised in Britain, Chantal Joffe has art in her blood — her mother is a watercolor painter and her brother is a contemporary artist and novelist. 
                Joffe herself attended the Camberwell College of Arts, Glasgow School of Art, and the Royal College of Art. Immediately following graduation, Joffe was honored with 
                the Delfina Studio Trust Award and the Abbey Scholarship to the British School at Rome. Her paintings primarily consist of women and children painted in large scale, 
                sometimes up to ten feet tall. Critics have pointed out Joffe’s skill at creating pieces with charm and childishness, but also “an unsettling quality which gives her 
                paintings an odd, rather menacing mood.” </p>

                <p>Powerfully drawn by the formal possibilities of the human body, one of most famous women painters from Britain Jenny Saville, creates a highly tactile 
                impression of surface and mass in her striking oil on canvas artworks. Though created in the figurative manner, her subjects are infused by sculptural 
                and ephemeral dimensionality that resembles the works of celebrated abstract artists. Although Saville’s methods and subject matter are both traditional, 
                the Young British Artist has somehow found a way to reinvent the art of figure painting. Much of her work features distorted flesh, high-caliber brush 
                strokes, and patches of oil color. Her work has been compared to that of Lucian Freud and Rubens.</p>
